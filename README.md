# emissary

Emissary is an attempt at creating an [OpenResty](https://openresty.org/en/)-like
reverse proxy in Go. It's merely a side project on which I can hack occasionally;
if you're looking for something much more suited to actual traffic, check out
[Traefik](https://traefik.io/).

## Possible Goals
* Dynamic configuration of origin sites
* Support for Lua plugins
* A dashboard for viewing frontend/backend configurations

## Inspirations/Helpful Articles
* [Golang Reverse Proxy](https://www.integralist.co.uk/posts/golang-reverse-proxy/)
